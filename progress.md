# Groceries Tracker

# Progress
- MongoDB cluster created and linked, but connection is refused when ran on Github 
    --> Will store users and grocery list information as dictionaries 
- User endpoints allow basic sign-ins
    --> Will be stored in MongoDB to get specific grocery lists
- List endpoints allow creation, reading, updating, and deletion of grocery items
    --> Completes the grocery list aspect of the project
- Grocery lists and individual details can be retrieved
    --> Need to retreive them for MongoDB
- Mongoshell commands seem to work with the MongoDB cluster, 
but when running a test, there seems to be no change in the database
    --> Will need to figure out how to interact with the MongoDB cluster
