Documentation of current issues:
- Some groceries methods not incorporated into endpoints
    - Revisit and see which ones are needed
- Grocery update endpoints have been reorganized and different fields can be updated
    note: this is not consolidated into one singular endpoint, 
    because it didn't seem to make sense; if we want one singular endpoint,
    we would have to figure out a different organization
- Mongodb should be connected now with the new environ var, but the get groc 
    endpoint isn't working because of our groceries structure in the db right now. 
    This might be because the current single item is wrong. so have to input 
    a new item to test the get item.
        - 4/23 update: add_item fixed to work with low-level organization
                issues due to parameter orders have been fixed, but if we 
                modify the organization of the document then we would need to 
                revisit this again
- Need to solidify what a document looks like, so all the code can follow the same regulations

Notes:
- Database is called "groceries"
- Collection is called "grocdb" at the moment
