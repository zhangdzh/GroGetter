Documentation of current issues:
- MongoDB connection inconsistent
- Some groceries methods not incorporated into endpoints
    - Revisit and see which ones are needed
- Grocery update endpoints have been reorganized and different fields can be updated
    note: this is not consolidated into one singular endpoint, 
    because it didn't seem to make sense; if we want one singular endpoint,
    we would have to figure out a different organization

Notes:
- Database is called "groceries"
- Collection is called "grocdb" at the moment
